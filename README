Simple example of click / hover ( mouse in / mouse out ) functionality in ImpactJS 
( it also check zIndex, and take only the top one entity )

Hope it will help you:) 

Just remember to add this line in to your init function in main.js ( it binds left mouse click into ImpactJS, so we can use this later :) 

ig.input.bind( ig.KEY.MOUSE1, 'mouse1' );
